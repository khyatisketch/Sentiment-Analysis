"This movie doesn't deserve 5 stars . It's a 10 on 10 . Alia Bhatt ,Vijay raz ,Ajay Devgn everyone just shines and Excel beautifully . I have always loved Alia's growth as an actor and she is one of the best we have . Sanjay Leela Bhansali is a maestro and he prooves it again. He beautifully paints the movie .I wish the people of this country grow up and get some brain and stop spreading unnecessary hate.",,neutral,0.516738176
"Seldom will you find, a performance so sublime, as you're taken on the journey, of Gangubai Kathiawadi, through a life she did not plan, having been sold by her man, into the streets of female labour, of the kind, most would not savour.

You can applaud as many western best female actors to your hearts content, but I've not seen any of them match the overwhelming and outstanding performance that Alia Bhatt gives us here, as she takes us on a journey through the brothels of Mumbai, of the pain and the punishment inflicted once you've been imprisoned in a world with no escape, and the incredible way that hope and belief can change the lives of everyone around you.

Absolutely outstanding!",,negative,0.14312546
"This is only the 2nd subtitled movie I've watched from India (1st one Badhaai Do) and I'm pleasantly surprised by the tough storyline of this movie and all the actor's emotional performances to help tell the story. To be honest, the inclusion of a little song and dance in such a harsh subject movie is a bit new to me but it was still a very good movie to see even subtitled. For those that have not seen any Indian movies, go see this one. It's well done. You may want to sit up a little closer to read the subtitles easier. I will be keeping my eye out for other movies from India.",,positive,0.637236774
"Gorgeous Bhansali sets, photography, soulful music and a career best performance by Alia Bhatt. Her voice, mannerisms and acting is spot on. Ajay devgan gives a powerful guest appearance.",,positive,0.882842302
"This was a good movie with top notch direction and acting by everyone especially Alia Bhatt who was really outstanding in her portrayal of Gangubhai.

However at 2hrs 32 mins the movie was extremely long and all of the songs were a complete hindrance and nuisance to the continuity of the film. Movies like these although quite good,have absolutely no repeat value whatsover. In other words after 5 or 10 years this motion picture is definitely not one you will ever want to watch again. Once is definitely enough!",,positive,0.890278399
"I wore my heart on sleeve and put my life in danger amid omicron surge to step in movie theater and got a piece of crap. Alia bhatt is a misfit don't go by paid reviews on YouTube they have taken a hefty money to put bhatt on cloud 9 The movie is just glorifying a pimp and whole movie seems like shot in inverter light, music is pretty bad, WTF was background score, dholida song dance when you see it in theatre is pretty bad seems like forced garba with no joy, just giving one star for Ajay devgan.",,negative,0.007274388
Whoever criticize the movie people label him as hate mongers but the fact is movie is very mediocre and story is very basic. Alia performance is good but story is very dragged. Not a good watch.,,negative,0.333649397
"No where near to Sanjay leela Bhansali's best. Average Movie with below par ending. Acting is good with Ajay Devgn and Vijay Raaz best in their roles and not to forget Jim Sarbh. Alia Bhatt main character is good. Music is also a big let down.

Didn't meet the expectations I have with the movie.",,positive,0.77433449

"Bollywood doing what it do best. Glorified of criminals, making them hero.

Story- Glorification of Prostitution

Alia Bhatt - Looks child Ajay Devgn - sultan mirza.

Casting is bad. Sets are good but don't represent real .

Bad songs. Thin sory.",,negative,0.225951657

"It was Alia Bhatt all the way, she stole the show from the first scene, Vijay Raaz was excellent and so was Ajay Devgan. Some scenes were spectacular especially enrolling the kids to nearby school and asking for the name of the father. The set was simply captivating and SLB did a good job in creating a set of Kamatipura. The Qawalli featuring Huma Qureshi was a good song with nice lyrics. Dialogues were very well written and we should not forget Jim Sarbh as generalist , very well acted in his small role . Very entertaining movie and entire cast and crew did a great job in making the movie. Nice to hear Shreya Ghosal after a long time. Evryone involved in the movie deserves an applause.",,positive,0.999950409
"This is one of those Bollywood movies, where an anti-hero is glorified and his illegitimate actions justified.

Alia is such a misfit to play the role, story has nothing new to offer, we've seen such sex-worker stories before in Bollywood... just too mediocre and repetitive.",,neutral,0.526948035
SLB usually delivers opulent films that are a treat for the eye. This was dull and I'm afraid Alia isn't a natural actress. I was distracted by the fact she looked like a child throughout. She doesn't have the skills to carry this off. I'm afraid this is a waste of time and money. Don't bother.,,negative,0.00202097
"Such a great storyline deserved better. Role of gangubai deserved someone like Sweta Tripathi, Radhika Apte or Samantha Ruth Prabhu.

When will we stop adoring these familial typical Bollywood starlet productions.

Waste of time this was.",,positive,0.728813648
"Loved the movie.

Superb Acting by all.

Alia Bhatt did a fantastic job.

Music was good.

The story was presented beautifully.

This movie was directed nicely.

Ajay Devgan played his role perfectly.",,positive,0.967986166
This movie is openly supporting a criminal by twisting things. Gangubai was no saint or a 'poor innocent victim' Gangubai kothewali was a criminal and used to be a don of red light area. Bollywood has reached lowest limit of whitwashing criminals. Pathetic.,,negative,0.161936611
"SLB must be the worst choice of filmmaker to make a movie on the gritty and sleazy underbelly of prostitution in Mumbai. A guy who is famous for the exceedingly lavish and pompous settings for his movies rather than any directorial abilities shouldn't be allowed near such topics with a barge-pole. The real individual on whom this movie is made was a non-glamourous, jaded prostitute/lady don in Mumbai's rather infamous Kamathipura. Bhansali has tried hard to glamourize the titular character by having her dance, pose and mouth flamboyant dialogues. Basically yet another poor attempt to make criminals look glamourous and fashionable.",,negative,0.098910823
"Following things i disliked 1. Over acting by main actors.

2. Same story of poor person becomes Don. It getting bored now of such stories now 3. Movie not in flow feels like disconnected.",,negative,0.02172753

"What's Good- This one is to step out from our regular world to face the harsh realities of life. This movie is one kind of rude, however necessary awakening.

I am amazed by background score and songs, especially by Shreya Ghoshal and Neeti Mohan ones. Just mesmerising!

The direction is very good and it virtually gets you in the ally of Kamathipura.

Better could be climax that could have been shorter which sounds lengthier.",,positive,0.834580064
"Wonderful acting by Alia Bhatt. She showed she is the best of her generation as always. She has been contributed to Gangubai completely. She has proved she is one of the best bollywood actresses in this movie just like Raazi highway udta panjab and dear zindagi.

So sorry for haters😂😂 they are such a poor guys they have been rating bad gangubai before it goes on screen. But again Alia shut their mouth with her amazing acting. Pour the water where it burns haters😂😂 Alia proved she is very talented and you talentless guys can do nothing to her carrer.",,negative,0.01926085
